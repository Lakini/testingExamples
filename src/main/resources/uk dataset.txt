The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain,
is a sovereign state in Europe. Lying off the northwestern coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great
Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland,
and many smaller islands.Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another state—the 
Republic of Ireland.[nb 9] Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to 
its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-southwest. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain
and Ireland. With an area of 242,500 square kilometres (93,600 sq mi), the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world
and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 22nd-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants.
Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.
